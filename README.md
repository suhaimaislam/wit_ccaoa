As a software engineering fellow at The WIT Project, we partnered with the non-profit Child Care Aware of America (CCAOA) to update the Wordpress website's content management system.

These are a collection of changes made to the website using PHP, Javascript, & HTML/CSS.
- Extended functionality of four text block editors on text alignment.
- Expanded the interactive SVG map block editor to include multiple user-display options based on states’ data.
- Developed website’s built-in Google Maps search engine for locating local childcare centers.
